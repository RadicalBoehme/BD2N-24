transcript
I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag.
 The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags.
 The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... 
If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

67318	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money.
I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67").
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S.
I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
